# Welcome to the WasmEdge Mentorship Program

The goal of this program is to provide a platform where mentees interested in contributing to WasmEdge can discover engaging project ideas and develop corresponding project proposals. This serves as essential preparation for programs such as LFX Mentorship, Google Summer of Code, and similar initiatives.
